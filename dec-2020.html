  waiting for updates, searching for opinions. This process keeps us forever suspended, forever updating, and forever in

  defectively but because they are working correctly."

  "Code culture can be solipsistic and exhausting. Programmers fight over semicolon placement and the right way to be
  object-oriented or functional or whatever else will let them feel in control and smarter and more economically safe,
  and always I want to shout back: Code isn't enough on its own. We throw code away when it runs out its clock; we
  migrate data to new databases, so as not to lose one precious bit. Code is a story we tell about data."

  feel in a society ruled by early risers. Simply put: These late sleepers are tired of being judged for a behavior they
  cannot easily control. If they can’t change their sleep patterns, maybe society should become more accepting of them."
